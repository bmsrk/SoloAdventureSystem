Hey, thanks for creating that NPC dialogue generator! Can you please add some information about the daily routine of the Collective's residents, such as what activities they engage in during the day and what time they usually wake up and go to bed? It would be helpful for me to know what kind of daily routine to expect when joining the Collective
