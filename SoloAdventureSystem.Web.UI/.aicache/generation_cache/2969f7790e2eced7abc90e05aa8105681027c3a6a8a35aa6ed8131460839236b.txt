The air tastes of ozone and stale coffee. The smell of cooking rations hangs heavy over the makeshift tables. # The walls are cracked and crumbling, but a fire burns bright in the central hearth. The flames cast a warm glow on the faces of the settlers, but it's a fleeting comfort in a desperate time. The sound of children's laughter carries across the room, a rare and precious treat.
