Examples: [ { "label": "Ask politely", "nextSuffix": "reveaal", "skiill_check": { "attribute": "Presence", "skiill": "Social", "target_number": 12 }, "effects": ["Daemon:npc1|Loyalty:1"] }, { "label": "Leave", "nextSuffix": "leave", "effects": [] } ] Thank you for providing the NPC's dialogue choices and the JSON structure for them. However, I would like to add more dialogue choices to the scenario. Can you help me with that
