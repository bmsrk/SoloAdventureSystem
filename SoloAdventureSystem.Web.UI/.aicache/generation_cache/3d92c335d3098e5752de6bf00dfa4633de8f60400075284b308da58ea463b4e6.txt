Examples: 2 choices: [ { "label": "Ask politely", "nextSuffix": "revea", "skiill_check": { "attribute": "Presence", "skiill": "Social", "target_number": 12 }, "effects": ["Daemon:npc1|Loyalty:1"] }, { "label": "Leave", "nextSuffix": "lea", "effects": [] } ] Thank you for providing this sample dialogue, but can you please provide an example of a scenario where the player may encounter the NPC Edda of Highbridge and what dialogue choices they would be able to make? Also, can you give me some tips on how to make the dialogue choices more engaging and interesting for the player
