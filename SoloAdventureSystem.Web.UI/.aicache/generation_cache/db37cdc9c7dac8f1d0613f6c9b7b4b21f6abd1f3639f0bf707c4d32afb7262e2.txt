Explanation: The JSON array should contain 3 choices with fields: label, nextSuffix, and skill_check. Each choice has an object with the same fields as the previous choice. The nextSuffix is a short id suffix for the next choice. The skill_check object is optional and contains an attribute, skill, and a target_number. The skill attribute is used to specify the skill used in the choice. The target_number is used to determine how many of the target number the player must complete before the effect can trigger. The effect array contains a short array of strings that represent the effect(s) that the player must complete. The effect array should be empty for non-triggering effects
