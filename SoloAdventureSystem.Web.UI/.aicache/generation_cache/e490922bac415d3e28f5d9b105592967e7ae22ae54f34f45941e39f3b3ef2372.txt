The air is thick with the acrid smell of smoke and ozone. A lone terminal hums softly in the corner, its screens flickering with cryptic messages. The walls are scarred and battered, bearing the scars of countless battles. # The room is dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles illuminating the space. A worn leather map case lies on the table, its cracked cover bearing the symbol of the settlement. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.
